## Overview

Kasa Web Platform is a complete revamp of Kasa's property rental site. The project involves transitioning from an outdated ASP.NET codebase to a modern JavaScript stack with NodeJS for the back-end and React for the front-end. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience with a responsive design based on Figma mockups.

## Features

- **Project Initialization:** Start the React project and develop the entire application, including React components and React Router routes, following the responsive Figma mockups.
- **Data Source:** Utilize a provided JSON file containing the 20 latest property listings as a temporary data source due to the ongoing back-end recruitment process.
- **Coding Guidelines:** Adhere to Kasa's coding guidelines, considering the usual use of Create React App but allowing flexibility for other bundlers like Vite.
